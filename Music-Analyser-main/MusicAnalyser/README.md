# Music Playlist Database Analysis

This project involves analyzing a **music playlist database** to provide insights into business growth and performance. The analysis is performed using **MySQL** to answer essential business questions by querying the dataset. The project demonstrates various SQL techniques such as joins, functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to extract meaningful insights.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **MySQL**: For database management and query execution.
- **MySQL Workbench**: For visualizing database structure and running SQL queries.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to examine the music playlist dataset using SQL queries to help a music store analyze its business growth. The project answers important business questions, such as:

- Identifying top-performing songs and artists.
- Analyzing customer behavior based on their playlist interactions.
- Gaining insights into the store's revenue trends.

## Key Features

- **Complex SQL Queries**: Utilizes SQL Joins, Aggregations, and CTEs to solve advanced business problems.
- **Data Insights**: Extracts actionable insights related to customer preferences, top songs, and revenue growth.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Analyzes how well different music tracks and albums are performing over time.

## SQL Techniques Used

1. **SQL Joins**: Used to combine data from multiple tables such as customers, playlists, tracks, and artists to extract meaningful information.
2. **Aggregations**: Applied various aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, and `AVG()` to generate business insights.
3. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Simplified complex queries by using CTEs for intermediate result sets.
